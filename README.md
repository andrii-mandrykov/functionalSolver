# equationSolver
Equation solver developed using functional programming which was the main goal.

Program able to solve algebraic equations of degree 2, 3, 4, 5. For now there is no algebraic solutions of algebraic equations of degree 6 and more complex ones.

During call program will wait for coefficients that should be prompted via command line:
Enter coefficients of your equation = (a, b, etc...) 

There should be placed coefficients: lista of numbers separated by space.
For example, for quadratic equation there should be 1 1 -2. And for cubic: 1 1 1 -3.
